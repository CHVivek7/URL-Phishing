# URL Phishing Detection

This project aims to detect phishing URLs by leveraging machine learning techniques. Phishing websites are designed to deceptively mimic legitimate sites to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, and financial data. This tool helps users identify whether a URL is a phishing threat before they interact with it, thereby enhancing online security.

## Introduction

The prevalence of phishing attacks necessitates robust detection mechanisms. While various methods exist, machine learning has proven to be highly effective in identifying these evolving threats. This project focuses on analyzing various features of a URL to classify it as legitimate or a phishing attempt. Key features that contribute significantly to the detection process include the use of **HTTPS**, characteristics of **anchor URLs**, and **website traffic** patterns.

---

## Features

* **Phishing URL Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models to identify malicious URLs.
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifies crucial URL features (e.g., HTTPS, AnchorURL, WebsiteTraffic) that influence the detection model's performance.
* **User-friendly Interface (Potential):** Designed to provide a clear indication to users about the safety of a given URL.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CHVivek7/URL-Phishing.git
    cd URL-Phishing
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:** (Assuming a `requirements.txt` file exists in your project with all necessary libraries)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you'll likely need to install these common data science libraries:*
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the project to test URLs for phishing:

1.  **Run the application/notebook:**
    * If your project includes a web application (e.g., `app.py`):
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and navigate to the address indicated (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
    * If your project is primarily a Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
        This will open a new tab in your web browser. Navigate to and open the main notebook file (e.g., `Phishing_URL_Detection.ipynb`).
2.  **Input a URL:** Within the application or notebook, you will find a designated area to input the URL you wish to check.
3.  **Get Prediction:** The system will process the URL and provide an output indicating whether it is classified as legitimate or a phishing attempt.
